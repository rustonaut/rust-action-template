    #BUG: Edited seems to not really be what it seems,
    #     at least the view times I tried editing title
    #     or description of the PR doesn't trigger this.
    #     This mean after removing `WIP:` you need to
    #     trigger a re-run manually, duh. Github should
    #     just add first party `WIP:` support.

  #TODO make this an action (even through we will still run it as a job here)
  # so that we can reuse it in cargo-audit.yml to only run audit when we either
  # where triggered by schedule or if not is-wip (also only do the is-wip check
  # if we where not triggered by schedule)
